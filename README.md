# Design Patterns

## Description
A collection of design patterns and idioms in Python [1].
Evolving guide to design patterns in the Python programming language. [2]


> Design principles is a category of software architecture.
> A design principle differs from an architecture decision in that a design principle is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast rule.
> For example, the design principle states that the development teams should leverage asynchronous messaging between services 
> within a microservice architecture to increase performance.
> An architecture decision (rule) could never cover every condition and option for communication between services,
> so a design principle can be used to provide guidance for the preferred method
> (in this case, asynchronous messaging) to allow the developer to choose a more appropriate communication protocol
> (such as REST or gRPC) given a specific circumstance. [3]
